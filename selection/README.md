# Results of the evaluation of the selection strategy based on patch length


The selection is evaluated on all  the mixed clusters (i.e., having both incorrect and correct patches).
In total, there is 27 mixed clusters from 24 bugs.



# Clusters where shortest patches are always Correct:  total  13, from 12 bugs
