## Data

We use tree existing datasets of Defects4J patches.
The patches are publicly available in the repositories of  those dataset, which we present below.

### Dataset DDR:


Data from this experiment (i.e., Patches) collected, processed and curated by Ye et al. available at [DRR](https://github.com/KTH/drr)
If you use the data please cite:

```
@Article{Ye2021EMSE,
    author = {Ye, He and Martinez, Matias and Monperrus, Martin},
    title = "Automated Patch Assessment for Program Repair at Scale",
    journal="Empirical Software Engineering",
    volume = "26",
    issn = "1573-7616",
    doi = "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-020-09920-w",
    year = "2021"
}
```


The patches are splitted in 3 folders: DCorrect (contains the correct), Doverfitting (contains the overfitting), Dunassesed (those not classified). 


### Dataset APR-Efficiency: 

The dataset of patches is available at [APR-Efficiency](https://github.com/SerVal-DTF/APR-Efficiency).
If you use this dataset, please cite:

On the efficiency of test suite based program repair: A Systematic Assessment of 16 Automated Repair Systems for Java Programs. In Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '20). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 615–627. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3377811.3380338
```

We apply several transformations on the data provided by Lui et al. which we encoded in the script [patchConverter.py](../src/transformers/patchConverterICSE2020.py).

First, many patches have noice and mistakes e.g., wrong file paths, reference to local folders, missing characters (e.g. ` ---`).

Second, we organize the patches according from the convention from Ye He et al. from DRR.
Consequently, we can analyze patches from Lui et al and from Ye He et al using the same scripts.

Important: the converter may not focus on all mistakes, so it would be necessary to apply the patch and to see the result.


### Dataset APIARTY

The dataset of patches is available at [APIARTY](https://github.com/SOLAR-group/APIARTy).
